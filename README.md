# Discovery App from Marklogic SampleStack

This application is derived from the [MarkLogic SampleStack](https://github.com/marklogic/marklogic-samplestack) and is implemented using Java, Spring, and Gradle.

The project includes the following major components:
* MVC browser application implemented in [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org)
* Middle appserver tier implemented in Java/[Spring](http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/)
* [MarkLogic](http://www.marklogic.com/) for the database tier
* [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/) framework to drive build and configuration of the appserver and database tiers
* Unit and end-to-end tests

This README covers the following topics:
* [Getting Started](#getting-started)
* [Additional Information](#additional-information)
* [License](#license)

## Getting Started

To start, clone this repository. For example, run the following command:  

```
git clone https://github.com/ryanjdew/discovery-app-w-samplestack
```

Ensure the [gradle.properties](appserver/java-spring/gradle.properties) configuration matches what you desire. You'll need to be sure that 'marklogic.admin.user' and 'marklogic.admin.password' match a MarkLogic user that has the admin role. The default ports to run on are 8006 (MarkLogic) and 8090 (Java Spring). These can also be adjusted appropriately in the gradle.properties.

```
cd discovery-app-w-samplestack
sh startup.sh
```

This will configure your MarkLogic install as necessary and then start a Java Spring application server. It will stop prior to hitting 100%, but you should see a message about a Tomcat instance starting.

From here, you can open your browser to http://localhost:8090/. Login with the credentials admin/admin (Note: This is a user setup provided with an included [ldif file](appserver/java-spring/src/main/resources/samplestack-ds.ldif), not a MarkLogic user.). Once you're logged the setup link in the top right corner will be available to take you to the Setup section where your application can be configured.
